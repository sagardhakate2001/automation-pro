    BrandMicrotail
    Voltage250 Volts
    Product Dimensions14L x 10.5W x 7H Centimeters
    MaterialPlastic
    Item Weight800 Grams
    For sensor installation, we recommend 0.5 square mm or less guage wire to be used like telephone cable. For power terminals, 2.5 Square mm wire to be used.
    6 Nos Stainless Steel Different Colour Sensors. Option to bypass three underground tank sensors by looping C-UL-UH together if underground tank not available. All three sensors into water tank are must be installed for automatic operation.
    Contact capacity : 30 A and Works Upto 2HP MCB type Starters & Direct two wires motor only
    In Automatic Mode fully automatic operation based on sensors feedback. No need to press any start or stop buttons in automatic mode. In manual mode only, motor on off done by START STOP buttons.
    Tank water level indications like UL(Underground Low-Red), UH(Underground High-Yellow), OL(Overhead Low-Yellow), OH(Overhead High-Red). Coulours of led's are used only for differentiation purpose. Motor on indication (Green).
    Working Logic of sensors is like, UL+UH= motor On, OL+OH= motor OFF, Below UL = motor Off, Below OL = motor On, C sensor for providing feedback to other sensors & it is necessary.
    1 Year warranty of controller. </P>  </div>
